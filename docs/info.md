## How it works

This is a modified D-Flip-Flop that stores the input D to output Q on _both_ the rising AND falling clock edge. There are also asynchronous SET and RESET inputs

## How to test

1. This can work with the automatic clock, but you won't be able to really observe its funcitonality unles you manually clock. Set the clock input to STEP mode.
2. Clear the output by pressing the RESET button
3. Set the switch for D to ON
4. Press down on the step button (without releasing) and it should show up on the output
5. Set the D to OFF
6. Release the clock and it should clear the output

## External hardware

List external hardware used in your project (e.g. PMOD, LED display, etc), if any
